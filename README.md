# E-commerce Electronics Store - A/B Testing
This repository contains my project materials for E-commerce A/B Testing. The notebook delves into various aspects of A/B testing applied in an e-commerce context. It covers exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, experiment design, and evaluation of A/B testing results using statistical methods.

The project uses a [**dataset from an electronics store**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-electronics-store/data) by [**Rees46**](https://rees46.com/) and implements a comprehensive approach to understanding user behavior, product performance, and the impact of changes on conversion rates.

# Results
Upon completion of this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in A/B testing within an e-commerce setting. The hands-on experience enhanced my skills in data analysis, hypothesis testing, and experiment evaluation, all critical for making data-driven decisions in the e-commerce industry. This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide and reference for similar future projects.
